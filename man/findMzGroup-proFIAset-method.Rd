\title{find a group in a FIA experiment.}
\usage{
\S4method{findMzGroup}{proFIAset}(object, mz, tol, dmz = 0.005, closest = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A proFIAset object.}

\item{mz}{A numeric vector of masses to be looked for.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance in ppm.}

\item{dmz}{The minimum tolerance in absolute mz compared to the tolerance in ppm.}

\item{closest}{Shall only the closest group be returned.}
}
\value{
A vector of integer of the same length than mz giving the row
of the found group in the object group slot, or NA if the group is
not found.

If closest is FALSE a list giving the index of the found group, if closest is TRUE a vector
giving the position. NA indicates that the mass signal have not bene found.
}
\description{
Find a group corresponding to the given mass in a proFIAset
object, given a tolerance in ppm.The mz considered for a group
is the median fo the grouped signals between the various acquisition.
}
\examples{
if(require("plasFIA")){
#proFIAset object is loaded
data(plasSet)

#The table of spiked molecule is loaded
data(plasMols)

#Mass to search and toolerance are defined
mass<-plasMols[22,"mass_M+H"]
tolppm <- 1

plasSet<- makeDataMatrix(plasSet)

index <- findMzGroup(plasSet,mass,tol=tolppm)

plasMols[22,]
#We extract the corresponding group.
groupMatrix(plasSet)[index,]
}
}
\seealso{
You can visualize the group using \code{\link{plotFlowgrams}} function.
