\description{
Plot a summary of an FIA acquisition. This summary aims to provides an overview of the
FIA acquisition and the processinf of FIA acquisition. It includes the following graphs :
\itemize{
    \item Barplot A barplot giving the number of peak detected in each sample. The number 
    of shifted peak is indicated, which can indicate wrong FIA-acquisition, as well as the
    number of peak badly with a low correlation with the injection peak, which can indicate
    a strong matrix effect.
    \item Injection_Peaks A representation of all the injection peaks of the acquisition, a
    greatly different peak in th einjection may indicate an issue with the injection, or a problem
    of regression. If the peaks seems all different, try to use \link{proFIAset} with the f
    paramter on TIC, to avoid regression.
    \item Density A density plot of the m/z of all the features found. A missing interval at the end
    of the mz range may indicate a too low ppm parameter, while a missing interval at the beginning
    of the mz range may indicate a too low dmz parameter.
    \item PCA A PCA plot to obtain a quick diagnostic of the data. The PCA plot is supposed to be different
    before and after imputation.
